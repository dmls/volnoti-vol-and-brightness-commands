# Volnoti Volume and Brightness Commands

A set of commands that can be used on their own or bound to volume and brightness keys that both adjust volume/brightness and use Volnoti to indicate their respective levels. 

### Requirements

These scripts utilize volnoti and xorg-xbacklight:

* [volnoti](https://github.com/hcchu/volnoti) - Volnoti is a lightweight volume notification daemon for GNU/Linux
* [xorg-xbacklight](https://www.x.org/wiki/) - RandR-based backlight control application



### Installation

After the requirements above have been installed:

Download or clone the repository and place the scripts into an executable path directory. The install.sh script in this repo will place them into /usr/bin/. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dmls/volnoti-vol-and-brightness-commands.git
cd volnoti-vol-and-brightness-commands
sh install.sh
```
